Step by step instructions about how to use SWIG on a minimal C++ to Java example:

Suppose now you already have a C++ project containing the following files:

myException.h (defines a new type of exception derived from std::runtime_error)
func.h, func.cpp  (defines a function that takes an int and print it or throw myException)

Step 1: Writing the SWIG interface file funcWrapper.i
Step 2: Call SWIG on command line and obtain the generated wrapper file funcWrapper.cxx and Java files
Step 3: Compile C++: Add the wrapper file to the C++ project and build to produce a dll
Step 4: Compile Java and make it into a jar if necessary
